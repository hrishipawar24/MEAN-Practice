Create angular application which creates two custom pipe named as MyAdd & MyMult. MyAdd pipe is used to add two numbers and MyMult is used to multiply two numbers. Example : {{8 | MyAdd : 3}} Output should be 11 {{7 | MyMult: 3}} Output should be 21 For this purpose we have to create two separate pipes and inside transform method of each pipe we have to write logic of addition and multiplication respectively. Consider below code snippet for reference import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core'; @Pipe (< name: 'MyAdd' }) export class MyAdd implements PipeTransform { transform(value: number, Param: string): number { // return addition of value and Param } Similarly we can write logic for MyMult pipe also.
